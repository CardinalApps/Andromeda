# i18n.js

Client side function for retrieving strings. Strings must be globalized as
`window.i18n` first by the app.

This was originally part of the
[Bridge](https://github.com/somebeaver/Bridge.js) library but it felt wrong
having i18n functionality there, and since it can't be part of the [CJS
i18n](https://github.com/somebeaver/cardinal-i18n) package because this is is
for an ES6 environment, this now lives as its own tiny package.

## Usage

```javascript
import i18n from 'i18n.js'

let stringValue = i18n('string-key')
```
